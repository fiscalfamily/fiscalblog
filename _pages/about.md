Hello,

We are the Fiscal Family - an international couple in their 30s and and their adorable toddler, living in Zug - one fiscal year at the time.

We like to get the most of our money, therefore we decided to join the fab money blogging community in Switzerland and exchange ideas on everything money related. Needless to say, we are very passionate about our financial goals and budgeting, therefore you can read a lot about topics like essentialism, modern consumption and spending, and just anything relating to ‘money vs value’.  

If you take any of our advice, please do so on your own risk as we are not financial advisors. But if you have advice, tips and tricks, or would just like to say ‘Hi’, please feel welcome to do so - we will be more than happy to hear from you!
